# Handmade Zero
Following [Handmade Hero](https://mollyrocket.com/#handmade) but with Zig.

I left git tags after i completed following each day of the serie.

NOTE: the code is more or less what casey wrote, i ziggified and took some liberties of changing some part to fit my style.

## Build
run `zig build run` on windows (the serie start only with windows)

## TODO:
- [ ] Create very small ziggified wrapper for system calls / c libs i use.
- [ ] expand platforms to linux / mac. (Don't count on it XD)
